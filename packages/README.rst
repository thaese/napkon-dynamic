FHIR Packages
=============

This directory includes tarballs of profile packages that include snapshots.
Snapshots are required by SUSHI to run, but cannot be automatically downloaded by it.
Therefore, the packages here have been downloaded from simplifier.net
and are used by the github publisher action to be extracted into its local ~/.fhir/packages/ directory.
For more information see https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/215610-shorthand/topic/Dependencies/near/230538588 .
